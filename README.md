# calculator
Calculator project from TOP

Activity log:

Used Grid CSS to create the calculator itself, practicing drafting a design on paper, measuring the proportional width of each track and assigning buttons to those.  On the second day, I added CSS styling to it to make it all look more like a calculator, but only did basic things like borders and font adjustments.
Third day I am working on javascript, and was able to add a live output feed on the display that allows the buttons to add their number to the output feed.
Fourth day (3/12) I am working on adding the operators into the equations and hopefully finishing the calculation side of things.
